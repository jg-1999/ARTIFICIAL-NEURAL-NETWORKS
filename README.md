# ARTIFICIAL-NEURAL-NETWORKS

Hi ðŸ‘‹

This repo is my space to play and experiment with artificial neural networks. You'll find simple models, examples with familiar datasets, and lots of code to tinker with. Nothing too fancy, but useful if you're just starting out or just want to see how these networks work internally.

What's in it?

- MLPs (basic neural networks)

- Various activation functions (ReLU, sigmoid, tanh...)

- Examples with datasets like MNIST, CERN, etc.

- Visualizations to better understand what's going on

- Commented code (as best I could ðŸ˜…)

This is a project under construction, so it will be updated regularly. If it helps, great. If you want to contribute, you're more than welcome!
